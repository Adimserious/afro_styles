### Data model

### Libraries used

## Deployment
The project was coded with gitpod, stored on github and then deployed to Heroku. 
The deployment was done this way:
1.  Create a requirements.txt with the terminal comand: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
2.  Pushed the latested code and requirements.txt on to Github.
3.	Log in to Heroku or create an account first.
4.	Click on the New Button on the dashboard in the top right corner.
5.	Click on "Create new app".
6.	Select the relevant region. In my case, I chose Europe.
7.  Select an app name that does not yet exist on heroku.
